        <p id='bio' className='paragraph'> I'm currently a sophomore at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford</a> pursuing degrees in <b>Physics</b> and <b>Management Science & Engineering</b> with a minor in <b>Math</b>. These broadly map to my academic interests in decentralized networking and algorithimic thinking, within the fields of robotics, market design and climate-tech.

            As a part of my studies, I'm part of Stanford's <a href="https://explore-energy.stanford.edu/explore-energy-house" target="_blank">Energy Theme House</a>, where I'm exploring my curiosity around decentralized energy networks. And this past year, I completed Stanford's <a href="https://sis.stanford.edu/structured-liberal-education-sle">Structured Liberal Education (SLE)</a> program, living and learning with an extraordinary group of friends. Here's a photo of SLE's annual yosemite trip!

            Earlier, I graduated from <a href="https://mvhs.fuhsd.org/" target="_blank">Monta Vista High School</a> in 2022, where I primarily led business and tech for <a href="https://elestoque.org/staff_name/devin-gupta/">El Estoque</a>. I also acted as class president at a time and co-presided the school's mock trial team.
            <br /><br />
            I've also been lucky to be able to attend some amazing conferences like TechCrunch Disrupt 2023, GCP's Fall Workshop and Cal Hacks. For any journalists, I'm an alum of <a href="https://www.medill.northwestern.edu/journalism/high-school-programs/medill-cherubs.html" target="_blank">Medill's Cherubs program</a> and have attended many JEA, NSPA and SNO workshops.

            I'm currently learning Spanish and Mandarin at Stanford, and speak Hindi and English. And I like to play the acoustic guitar sometimes - currently learning '<a href="https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-mayer/slow-dancing-in-a-burning-room-tabs-449994" target="_blank">Slow Dancing in a Burning Room</a>' by John Mayer.
