# hey! welcome to my personal website

You can find it [here](devin-gupta.github.io). I built it over a weekend while dropping my brother off in Chicago!

I used next.js, tailwind and typescript, but it's primarily HTML with a dynamic content section.

Here are some cool sites/mentors I took inspiration from: [Tom Knowles](https://tomknowles.com/), [Nik Marda](https://nikmarda.com/), [Leerob](leerob.io) and [Kiran Tomilson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kt/)

Please reach out if you'd like to chat or learn more about me.
