                <div class="wide sep"></div>
                <p> * note, this website is currently under construction and is being modelled after someone I have much respect for : <a href="https://www.nikmarda.com">nikmarda.com</a> </p>
                <p>
                    I work on public policy to help advance the use of trustworthy artificial intelligence. I also support efforts to use technology to make public services more effective and equitable.</p>
                <p>I currently work on AI policy at the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/" target="_blank">White House Office of Science and Technology Policy</a>, where I am a Policy Assistant in OSTP's Technology Division and <a href="https://www.ai.gov/" target="_blank">National AI Initiative Office</a>. Previously, I consulted on tech policy for <a href="http://datasociety.net/" target="_blank">Data & Society</a>, assisted with AI ethics for the <a href="https://www.nscai.gov/" target="_blank">National Security Commission on AI</a>, and helped with tech strategy and delivery for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_transition_of_Joe_Biden" target="_blank">Biden-Harris Transition Team</a> and the <a href="https://techtalentproject.org/" target="_blank">Tech Talent Project</a>.</p>
                <p>I graduated with honors from Stanford University, receiving an M.S. in computer science and a B.A. in political science. While at Stanford, I led multiple public interest tech <a href="https://pitlab.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">organizations</a> and <a href="https://techhistory.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">projects</a>, conducted <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3359311" target="_blank">some research</a> in human-computer interaction, and completed a <a href="https://www.codingitforward.com/fellowship" target="_blank">Civic Digital Fellowship</a> at the National Institutes of Health. I was also named a Truman Scholar and a Gardner Fellow.</p>
                <p>I'm a big fan of being outdoors (especially stargazing), listening to audiobooks, drinking Caribou Coffee, making wildly uneducated Fermi estimates, and scrolling endlessly on Twitter â€” which is the best place to <a href="https://twitter.com/nrmarda" target="_blank">get in touch</a>!</p>
